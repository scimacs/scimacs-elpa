This package is a frontend to ripgrep (rg) and works in a similar
way to Emacs built in `rgrep' command.  It depends on and reuse parts
of built in grep with adjustments to ripgrep and is compatible with
`wgrep'.

Install the package and bind the main entry point `rg':
(eval-after-load
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-s") 'rg))

There are also other entry points for easy searching:
`rg-project' - Search in a project.
`rg-dwim' - Handsfree search. Search thing at point in project in
files matching the type alias of the current buffer file name.

The `rg' results buffer has bindings for modification of
the last search for quick reruns with refined parameters.
Possible refinements are: toggle case insensitive search, toggle
'--no-ignore' flag, change directory, change file pattern and change
search string.  See `rg-mode' for details.

This package (just as grep.el) use the setting of
`case-fold-search' variable to decide whether to do a case
sensitive search or not.  The behavior is similar to the ripgrep
'--smart-case' flag in that the search will be case insensitive if
`case-fold-search' is non nil and search pattern is all lowercase.
Otherwise it's case sensitive

ripgrep has built in type aliases that can be selected on
invocation of `rg'.  Customize `rg-custom-type-aliases' to add your
own aliases:
(setq rg-custom-type-aliases
  '(("foo" .    "*.foo *.bar")
    ("baz" .    "*.baz *.qux")))

The `rg-define-toggle' macro can be used to define a toggleable
flag for the rg command line. Such flags can then be toggled from
the results buffer and the search repeate with updated flags.
