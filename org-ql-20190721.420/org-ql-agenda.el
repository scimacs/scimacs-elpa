;; This library is part of the package `org-ql'; it's not a standalone

;; FIXME: DRY these two macros.

(cl-defmacro org-ql-agenda (&rest args)
  "Display an agenda-like buffer of entries in FILES that match QUERY.

FILES-OR-QUERY is a sexp that is evaluated to get the list of
buffers and files to scan.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query.  The query may be passed as
FILES-OR-QUERY and QUERY may be left nil, in which case the list
of files will automatically be set to the value of calling
`org-agenda-files'.

SORT is passed to `org-ql', which see..

NARROW, when non-nil, means to respect narrowing in buffers.
When nil, buffers are widened before being searched.

BUFFER, when non-nil, is a buffer or buffer name to display the
agenda in, rather than the default.

SUPER-GROUPS is used to bind variable `org-super-agenda-groups',
which see.  If t, the existing value of `org-super-agenda-groups'
is used, rather than binding it locally."
